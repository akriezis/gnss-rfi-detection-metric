GNSS RFI detection metric using SBAS C/N0 and PSD-adjusted received power 

This script is supplemental to the NAVIGATION paper GNSS Jamming and Spoofing Monitoring Using Low-Cost COTS Receivers. It offers detection criteria for GNSS RFI monitoring using the C/N0 measurements of SBAS satellites alongside the received power density adjusted for the GPS L1 C/A frequency. The detection criteria are dependent on the mean values recorded by a GNSS receiver under nominal conditions.
